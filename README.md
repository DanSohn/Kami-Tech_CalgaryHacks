# Kami-Tech_CalgaryHacks
The Kami-Tech team submission for the 2020 Calgary Hacks

Our Inspiration:
One major issue we face in our Calgary climate is safety hazards due to the unpredictable weather. 
We've all experienced slipping on the death traps leading to the C-Train station here at the university, 
or we know someone who has. It can be dangerous, and we wanted to create a solution for this problem. 
We aim to improve safety and the campus experience at the university by providing our fellow campus 
dwellers with a way to mitigate this problem. Additionally, we provide maintenance staff with real-time hazard information.

What we did:
1) Created and sanitized a high-quality dataset comprised of over 500 images using the Bing Search API and Pandas.

2) Constructed a reliable data pipeline to feed images to our ML model.

3) Designed and engineered a convolutional neural network using TensorFlow and Keras.

4) Validated the model on a second dataset.

5) Packaged the model into a micro-service and linked it to a no-SQL database (MongoDB).

6) Designed a cross-platform front-end mobile application to develop a high-quality user experience.

7) Linked it all up!
